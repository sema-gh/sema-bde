# Grundlegende Projektbestandteile

## Boilerplate

### [Electron-Vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue)

> An Electron & Vue.js quick start boilerplate with vue-cli scaffolding, common Vue plugins, electron-packager/electron-builder, unit/e2e testing, vue-devtools, and webpack.

> The aim of this project is to remove the need of manually setting up electron apps using vue. electron-vue takes advantage of vue-cli for scaffolding, webpack with vue-loader, electron-packager or electron-builder, and some of the most used plugins like vue-router, vuex, and so much more.

Grundlage der App. Struktur wurde beibehalten und erweitert. Die Dokumentation der Boilerplate bietet einen idealen Einstieg in die Weiterentwicklung der App.

## Node Module

> The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)

> Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases.

### [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)

> Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

### [Vue-Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)

> Vue-Router is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze.

### [Element-UI](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element)

> A Vue.js 2.0 UI Toolkit.

### [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb)

> PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser. PouchDB was created to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online. It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online, keeping the user's data in sync no matter where they next login.

### [AmCharts](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts3)

> A go-to library for data visualization. When you don’t have time to learn new technologies. When you need a simple yet powerful and flexible drop-in data visualization solution.
